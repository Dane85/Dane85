<p align="left">
Hi, I'm Dane! 👋

I'm a results-driven Software Developer with a passion for creating secure, large-scale SaaS applications. My professional life is focused on building and protecting digital solutions, and I'm currently on a dedicated journey to transition fully into the field of Cybersecurity.

Professionally, I work as a Frontend Web Developer at Jonas Club Software. My role goes beyond design; I develop and maintain secure SaaS applications on Microsoft Azure, implementing SSL, Azure Key Vault, and secure API endpoints. I also create Python scripts to automate vulnerability checks, collaborating directly with the cybersecurity and DevOps teams to remediate issues and implement OWASP best practices.

Academically, I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computing and Information Systems from Athabasca University. My coursework in 'Operating Systems' and 'Computer Networks' is building a deep foundation in the core infrastructure I aim to protect. To formalize my security transition, I am currently in progress with my CompTIA Security+ certification. My goal is to leverage my development background to specialize in application security, vulnerability management, and secure cloud operations.
